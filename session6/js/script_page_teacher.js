    `The ancient Greeks called cake πλακοῦς (plakous), which was derived from the word for "flat", πλακόεις (plakoeis). It was baked using flour mixed with eggs, milk, nuts, and honey. They also had a cake called "satura", which was a flat heavy cake. During the Roman period, the name for cake became "placenta" which was derived from the Greek term. A placenta was baked on a pastry base or inside a pastry case.`,

As a result of the bite, he gains superhuman strength, speed, and agility, along with the ability to cling to walls, turning him into Spider-Man. Parker also acquired a precognitive “spidey-sense” that alerted him to approaching dangers.`,

    `Aside from the obvious bonus of being able to talk with your loved ones that have since passed on, speaking with the dead would also be majorly helpful in solving the unsolvable crimes. Can't figure out who killed the victim? Easy: Ask the victim, case closed. Proving that in a court of law is another thing entirely, but having a prosecuting attourney with the power of persuasion would probably help.`,
    `A dissertation tesis doctoral, with an average of 250 pages, is the main requisite along with typically one previously published journal article. Once candidates have published their written dissertations, they will be evaluated by two external academics evaluadores externos and subsequently it is usually exhibited publicly for fifteen natural days.`,
    `In Portugal and Brazil, a dissertation is required for completion of a master's degree. The defense is done in a public presentation in which teachers, students, and the general public can participate. For the PhD, a thesis tese is presented for defense in a public exam. The exam typically extends over 3 hours.`,
    `Additionally, he notes, many people who believe they suffer from excessive gas production actually just have trouble with the flow of that gas through their intestines, perhaps due to constipation. Or they might make the same amount of gas but emit it more frequently, in smaller doses. In either case, Kashyap says, by changing your diet, you're not solving the problem and may in fact be harming yourself.`,

    `Failing in life helps to build resilience. The more we fail, the more resilient we become. In order to achieve great success, we must know resilience. Because, if we think that we're going to succeed on the first try, or even the first few tries, then we're sure to set ourselves up for a far more painful failure.`,
